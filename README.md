I am using https://github.com/ServiceStack/Bundler for a project and needed to compile the bundle when a file is modified. I am using VS2012 and they say it supports compile on save but I could not get it to work. I used https://github.com/bevry/watchr to watch my /less/ directory and run the "bundler" command if any files have been modified. It's pretty simple really.
